# Will Reed
Hi, I'm a 26 year old *mostly* self-taught programmer.  
Here are a few of my projects on GitHub:  

[UDLaunch](https://github.com/wreedb/udlaunch)
: A daemon/anything launcher for linux; It can start all the programs you need  
from a single command- with *exactly* the configuration you need for each process.

[Alice-CLI](https://github.com/wreedb/alice-cli)  
: A querying tool for my terminal color scheme: **Alice**. It can output  
the full palette of colors in a number of useful formats, such as:  
HSL, HWB, RGB, and hexadecimal for use with different endeavors.  
It is currently available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/alice-colorscheme).

About Me
==========
I'm a 26 year old *mostly* self-taught programmer.
Here are some of my software projects:

---
#### [God](https://github.com/wreedb/god)
The specification for a data serialization format I created, 
which is a subset of the [Nix](https://nixos.org) programming language. 
It omits all of the programming features of Nix in favor of 
representing static data.

---
#### [Guile-god](https://github.com/wreedb/guile-god)
The reference implementation parsing library for **God**, 
written in [Guile Scheme](https://gnu.org/software/guile).

---
#### [Guile-ninja](https://github.com/wreedb/guile-ninja)
A [Guile](https://gnu.org/software/guile) module for generating [Ninja](https://ninja-build.org) files.
It is similar in functionality to the upstream `ninja_syntax.py` file that the project provides for
generating simple `build.ninja` files.

---
#### [Altr](https://github.com/wreedb/altr)
A reimplementation of the classic `update-alternatives` family of programs for maintaining
groups of symbolic links. Written in [D](https://dlang.org) and uses an [SQLite](https://sqlite.org) backend.

---
#### [UDLaunch](https://github.com/wreedb/udlaunch)
A daemon/anything launcher for linux; It can start all the programs you need
from a single command- with *exactly* the configuration you need for each process.

---
#### [Alice-cli](https://github.com/wreedb/alice-cli)
A querying tool for my terminal color scheme: **Alice**. It can output
the full palette of colors in a number of useful formats, such as:
HSL, HWB, RGB, and hexadecimal for use with different endeavors.
Written in [Swift](https://swift.org) for Linux.

---
#### [Alice-themes](https://github.com/wreedb/alice-themes)
Contains configuration files for many different pieces of software
using my **Alice** color scheme.
